# job_portal_dapp
The Migrant Worker Dapp smart contract is designed to create a decentralized platform that connects laborers and job providers. It leverages the Ethereum blockchain to ensure transparency and trust in the hiring process. Applicants can register, provide their work history and skills, apply for jobs, and receive ratings, while job providers can list job opportunities. The contract employs Solidity, the language of smart contracts, and defines data structures and functions to facilitate the core operations of the Dapp. It aims to empower workers by helping them build a job history and improve their employment prospects.
